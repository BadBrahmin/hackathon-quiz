# What is the project about?

## Problem

Job interviews can be hard and intimidating. While companies have unique approaches to interviewing potential candidates over multiple rounds, technical rounds are common across all of them. Companies will ask you questions based on the stack they use or have you write code in a IDE.

Question rounds can be unnerving. You sit facing a HR/Head of Engineering/ CEO and even the simplest questions can wipe your memory slate. The pressure to be correct overwhelms all the preparation you did.

## Solution

**If preparation is king, then composure is queen.**

Dev-Prepped prepares a candidate to answer relevant technical questions but with a time-constrain. As the candidate attempts and succeeds answering a range of categorised questions under pressure, response time increases. Yes, correct answers > quick replies but we can achieve both!

# Tech-stack used:

- HTML-CSS
- React
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB

## Instructions for collaboration

- Clone the project and create a new branch out of `develop` that should be named as `<your initials>-<name of section>` e.g. `TA-home`, `ta-backend`.
- Do not make any changes in `master` or `develop`.
- Do not send PR's to `master`. Send them to `develop`.
- Have a `mobile-first` approach to design the website.
- Keep the `classnames` meaningful and avoid classname conflicts in CSS and write reuseable code.
- In case of merge conflicts, compare your branch with `develop` and `pull` if necessary.
